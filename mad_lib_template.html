    {{female name}} was a {{job title}} who loved technology. Although she loved parts of her job, she absolutely hated  {{tedious task}} and {{dirty task}}. So, {{female_name}} met with her life mentor {{celebrity}} who told her to learn how to {{useless skill}} with Thinkful. Thinkful didn't offer a course on {{useless skill}} so she studied programming instead. What a great decision! With her new skills, {{female name}} built a(n) {{adjective}} robot named {{obnoxiuous celebrity}} that not only loved {{dirty task}} but did it {{huge number}} faster.
